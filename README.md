🕸️ **Web Scraping Project 5: Blog Article Scraper** 🕸️

🚀 **Overview**
Welcome to the fifth project in our web scraping series! 🎉 This project takes web scraping to the next level by extracting detailed article information from a blog and saving it to a JSON file. We'll scrape article details, including titles, authors, publication dates, and content, and handle pagination to scrape multiple pages. This project is perfect for those looking to deepen their web scraping skills and work with more advanced data structures.

📂 **Project Structure**
Here’s how the project is organized:
Copy
web-scraping-project-5/
├── src/
│   └── main.py
├── data/
│   └── articles.json
└── README.md
src/: Contains the Python script (main.py) that performs the web scraping.
data/: Stores the output JSON file (articles.json) containing the scraped data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

📚 **Dependencies**
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
requests: For making HTTP requests to the website.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
json: For saving data to a JSON file.
You can install these dependencies using pip:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
