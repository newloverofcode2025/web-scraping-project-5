# web-scraping-project-5
 A web scraper that extracts data from a website with a more complex structure, such as a blog or news site. We'll scrape articles, including titles, authors, publication dates, and content, and save this data to a JSON file. This project will also introduce you to handling more complex HTML structures and extracting data from multiple pages.
